# Learning Log - Session 3 - (1/26) - Iterating with AI

## Ten Specific Things I don't know Yet (from the code ChatGPT produced)
1. meta
2. div
3. /p
4. span class = "badge"
5. /header
6. !-- Entry form --
7. STORAGE_KEY
8. /** @type {Entry[]} */
9. function uid() {return (crypto?.randomUUID?.() ?? ("id_" + Math.random().toString(16).slice(2))) + "_" + Date.now();}
10. id: String(e.id || uid())
11. Honorable Mention: Any functions (especially really long ones, like in #9)

## What I Learned Today
Today I learned about integrating AI into GitHub as well as how to iterate it. Further, within the AI, I got my first look at how AI can help with coding and how exactly it tends to go about that. It was interesting to see how much of an efficient tool AI can be, especially when it comes to the more tedious elements of coding/programming. 

## Challenges I Faced
Initially I had an issue with following the instructoins you gave. I think I'd often get confused and forget how to go about finding something I was having difficulty with. But over time, and with your further clarifications, I was able to figure out exactly what you were asking me to do. 

## AI Usage
The AI usage I had today was pretty much an extension of the previous class. Essentially, I just took my same prompt from before submitted it to ChatGPT, and had it spit out a detailed code for me. From there I did exactly what the instructions said for integrating it into GitHub. So far, although I don't know much about the coding elements it used, it spit out an outcome that I like and am excited to learn more about. 

## Questions for Next Time

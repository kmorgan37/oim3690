# Learning Log - Session 2 (1/22)

My frustration today was when the professor would move a little too quickly for me to follow, but thankfully the person next to me was willing to help me out when I was lost or falling behind. This was also nice because whenever she started to fall behind and I was ahead, I was able to help her out.

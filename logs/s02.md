# Learning Log - Session 2 - (1/22) - Version Control & GitHub

## What I Learned Today
Mainly today we focused on using our primary programs, Visual Studio Code and GitHub, and getting used to them. We also downloaded Git to make using those programs run more seamlessly. We also made two new repos, our OIM3690 repo and our username.github.io repo. This introduced us to basic workflows that we can use as we manage using  GitHub and VSC. Other than this basic familiarization with these new programs, we also used AI to see how our prompts allow us to create the code we want to make. 

## Challenges I Faced
Today I mainly had diffficulty just keeping pace with Professor Li. I think that with learning this new program it took me more time than usual to follow along, so often I'd get a step behind and have to ask Prof. or the person next to me to help me. 

## AI Usage 
Today I used ChatGPT to try and make a personal website for me using a index.html link. I created a paragraph with 3 sentences answering the questions: "Who amm I?" "What is this for?" and "What do you want this site to include?". This was my response: I am Kelly Morgan, a Junior Babson student from Chicago, IL. This website is for my persona documentation of my life and the world around me. I want it to include what I see and experience, how I view those, and other thoughts I tend to have. I then created this prompt in chat, "Can you turn this idea into a coding file that does what I say in the text, and that when the file is created, I can transport it seamlessly to GitHub "I am Kelly Morgan, a Junior Babson student from Chicago, IL. This website is for my persona documentation of my life and the world around me. I want it to include what I see and experience, how I view those, and other thoughts I tend to have."" I didn't have time to use or modify the output, but if I had, I would have put it into GitHub beforehand to see if it had given me what I wanted, and if not, then I would have adjusted the code. 

## Questions for Next Time
So far nothing is unclear. However, I was wondering if maybe for future classes that when you are showing us how to code something new you could ask us if we are following along? This was we can keep up with you better. Maybe even go a teensy bit slower to maintain a good pace the class can follow you better with.
